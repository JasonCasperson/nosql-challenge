# nosql-challenge
Demonstrates ability to store data using MongoDB a nosql distributed database program.


Data was ingested through a json source document. I was able to effectively create an instance of a MongoDB and perform some basic edits on the data with read/write commands. After that I performed a variety of queries on the database, demonstrating an ability to work with a non-relational database. Finally, this challenge involved getting the data into pandas dataframes that I could further use to build out visualizations/analyis or run machine learning algorithms.
